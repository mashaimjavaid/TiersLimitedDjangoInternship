Artificial intelligence, or AI, is not just a buzzword—it is rapidly becoming an 
essential part of modern life. From smartphones to smart homes, from personalized 
recommendations to automated customer service, AI is everywhere. The use of AI in 
education, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment is expanding daily. AI 
helps doctors diagnose diseases, it helps students learn more effectively, and 
it even helps drivers stay safe on the road. As AI systems become more intelligent, 
more reliable, and more integrated into society, questions about ethics, fairness, 
and transparency become increasingly important. The same AI that helps solve problems 
can also create new ones if not used responsibly. Therefore, AI developers, users, and 
governments must work together to ensure that the benefits of AI are shared widely and 
the risks are minimized. In this age of innovation, the power of AI is both a tool and 
a test—a test of our ability to guide technology for the greater good.
